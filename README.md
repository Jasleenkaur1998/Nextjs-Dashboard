## ReactJs + NextJs 13 app

## Objective: Create an application with React and Next that utilizes data fetching from an API. Apis listed here, used in this app

# For listing the tasks in dashboard
- https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos

# For listing the heros in home

- https://reqres.in/api/users

# For fetching profile information

- https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1


## Project Requirements: 
1. Home page '/' with a very simple layout (Navbar with a logo and a Login button) and a Hero section as the content (you can provide any content like a hero image or a carousel component, but don't spend too much time on this hero section).

2. When you click the Login button, 
Present a page '/dashboard' with a Left-side menu containing 2 menu items: "My Tasks" and "My Profile"

3. The content must be a table rendering data fetched from the backend (something like "My Tasks").
The backend requires no database integration - returning a hardcoded JSON would be ok.
A second page rendering a form with data fetched from the backend "My profile".
The Logout button navigates back to the Home Page.
